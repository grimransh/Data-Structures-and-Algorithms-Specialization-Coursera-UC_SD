// In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 0, b = 0, sum = 0;
    cin >> a >> b;
    sum = a + b;
    cout << sum;
    return 0;
